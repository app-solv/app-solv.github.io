High liquidity in DeFi platforms ensures that users can buy and sell assets quickly and at fair prices. However, many DeFi projects struggle with liquidity challenges, leading to slippage and inefficient capital utilization.<br><br><b>Challenges in Traditional DeFi Liquidity:-</b><br><b>1.Fragmented Liquidity:</b> Many DeFi platforms operate independently, leading to fragmented liquidity across multiple protocols. This fragmentation can result in price discrepancies and reduced trading efficiency.<br><br><b>2.Capital Inefficiency:</b> Traditional liquidity pools often require significant capital to provide meaningful liquidity. This can deter smaller investors from participating and limit overall market depth.<br><br><b>3.Inflexible Financial Products:</b> Many existing DeFi products are rigid and do not cater to diverse investor needs. Users may find it challenging to access tailored investment strategies that match their risk tolerance and investment goals.</p>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"item features-without-image col-12\">\n              <div class=\"item-wrapper\">\n                <h4 class=\"mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-3\" mbr-if=\"showSubtitle\" data-app-selector=\".mbr-section-subtitle\" mbr-theme-style=\"display-5\"><b>How Solv Finance Addresses Liquidity Challenges</b></h4>\n                <p class=\"mbr-text mbr-fonts-style\" mbr-theme-style=\"display-7\" mbr-if=\"showText\" data-app-selector=\".mbr-text, .mbr-section-btn\"><b>1.
